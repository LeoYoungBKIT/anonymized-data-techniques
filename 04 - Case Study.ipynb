    "In this notebook, we'll explore the possibilties for data privacy on a new dataset. In this notebook, you'll be asked to work in small groups, so make friends with someone seated near you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge is that you are working with a health care provider, who would like to do the \"machine learning\" on this dataset to figure out if there are preventative measures that can be taken so fewer patients are seen in the hospital for related care or so that their visits are shorter. The goal is that more potentially affected patients are given access to primary care physicians and regular medication or visits that can keep them out of the hostpital for long stays. This study is focused on blood-sugar related illnesses, but not only diabetes.\n",

    "Using this dataset, we'll walk through a few possible scenarios and apply what we have learned today about data privacy to this new use case."
